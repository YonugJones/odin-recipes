    <h2>"Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, for wise men say it is the wisest course"</h2>
        <h3>- William Shakespeare</h3>
        <br>
    <p>I bet you thought I had an all liquid diet! <strong>HA!</strong> Sour cream is a solid! And this treat will become a solid member in your recipe book just like it has become in mine.</p>
    <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of <strong>whole</strong> milk</li>
        <li>toothpicks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's what you'll do:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>whisk your cream and juice together</li>
        <li>let stand for 10 - 15 minutes</li>
        <li>add your milk and stir well!</li>
        <li>cover the jar with a cheesecloth and let sit for 24 hours</li>
        <li>once settled, pour into an ice cub try, cover with film, and poke each sour cream cube with a toothpick</li>
        <li>place in a freezer until frozen. Then take out and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>CAUTION!</strong> Stop yourself before eating the full tray. I <strong>WOULD NOT </strong> recommend it. I've spent a lot of nights in the bathroom because of how <strong>GOOD </strong>this recipe is :p</p>
