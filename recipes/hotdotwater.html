        <br>
    <p>Don't let the soviets get a hold of <strong>this </strong>recipe! This <em>tasty</em> treat will take you to the moon and back. The best part is, you probably already have most of the ingredients at home!</p>
    <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>36 hot dogs</li>
        <li>4 gallons of water (dasani is my preferred brand!)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's what you'll do:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water</li>
        <li>add your hot dogs, salt, and garlic to the water (all at once!)</li>
        <li>boil the dogs until you can't wait no more cuz you're <em>sooo</em> excited to drink that sweet dog nectar</li>
        <li>Discard the dogs (OR if you're on a budget, put them in a resealable bag and freeze them for another round, probably later tonight ;)</li>
        <li>DRINK!</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Easy right?! Let me know what you think! If you like them half as much as I do, I know you'll have this in regular rotation for you and your family.</p>
