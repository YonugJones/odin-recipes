        <p>Smell that? That's right. The fruity, indescrible smell or mutliple oil types melding together will take you right back to family meal time. 
            Yaaa it's simiple and I'm sure Gordan <strong>SHAM</strong>sey would have a thing or two to say about this but hey, sometimes <em>there's no place like momma's home cooking.</em></p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>4 pumps canola oil</li>
            <li>3 pumps avocado oil</li>
            <li>1.5 pumps <em>extra virgin</em> olive oil</li>
            <li>1 squirt of stovetop grease oil (you should have lots of this if you made my <a href="./hotdotwater.html">previous recipe</a></li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Here's what you'll do:</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>just start pumpking those liquids in!</li>
            <li>mix the oils together. It's important you do not add <em>ANY</em> water to this. You know what they say..</li>
            <li>After about 15 minutes the oil should have a good froth</li>
            <li><strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> pour this oil into your pan that should have been preheating. You want that oil nice and hot</li>
            <li>after 30 seconds cut the eat and pour into your serving container of choice (I like cups!)</li>
    
        </ol>
    
        <p>I am so jeolous right now!! You have such a <em>yummy </em>treat in front of you and I don't have anything :(</p>
